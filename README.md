# VCM Pitch Timer

## Description

The VCM Pitch Timer is an application designed to help startup enthusiasts and potential founders manage and time their pitch presentations. It provides a simple and intuitive interface to set up timers for different sections of a pitch, ensuring that users stay on track and within their allotted time. This tool is especially useful for students and professionals who need to deliver concise and effective presentations at the end-of-semester event of the Venture Club MÃ¼nster.

The app features a ticking sound for the last 10 seconds of the timer and a gong sound when the time expires, helping presenters to wrap up their pitches effectively.
